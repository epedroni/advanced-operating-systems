Porting notes
--------------
A generic description of the porting process can be found here:
  http://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib

* This only contains the subset of full source tree.
  - autoconf build system removed and replaced with Hake.
  - This is the default libc but that can be changed in `hake/Config.hs`.
  - libgloss was removed. This usually provides startup code and some basic
    syscalls (e.g. _exit, sbrk, kill).  In the case of Barrelfish these are in
    posixcompat and //lib/crt0 respectively.

* libc and libm are used verbatim with no/minimal modifications.
  Most functions are included, although some are omitted because they are not
  supported or simply because they have not been needed yet.
  Notable omissions: iconv, (reent), posix, signal, stdio64, unix, xdr

* A thin layer implements a small number of Barrelfish-specific system calls:
    newlib/libc/sys/aos/*syscalls.c

* Some header files are shadowed (e.g. <unistd.h>) -- i.e. they exist in both
  `//include` and `newlib/libc/include`.  If there are missing definitions,
  make sure to add them to the first one.  Some other headers (e.g. <signal.h>)
  have been renamed so they are not found, since these are not available on
  Barrelfish.
